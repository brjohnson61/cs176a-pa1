Conclusion/Thoughts:
    This project has taught me a lot about UDP.  I used website: http://www.baeldung.com/udp-in-java to gain knowledge about udp in general,
    and based my thought process around their sample server/client.  However, the code I have in my final project has evolved tremendously as both my
    code and understanding has completely evolved through debugging and changing my code around, so there are not any snippets in my project that I used directly from
    the code written on this site.  The other site I used for reference was the official oracle website to get the return values and information
    about methods built into the java libraries I am using.  For the tcp portion of this project I did not use any code snippets other than how to
    run a system command in java for linux.  I reference this location in my code.  The reason for this is that I am also enrolled in cs171 and I
    used tcp to communicate with multiple servers and clients simultaneously, so the knowledge of tcp that I used in this project was from prior 
    experience.  Thank you for taking the time to read this, and have a great day.
